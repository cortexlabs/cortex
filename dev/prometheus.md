## Re-introducing dropped metrics/labels

If you need to add some metrics/labels back for some particular use case, comment out every `metricRelabelings:` section (except the one from the `prometheus-operator.yaml` file), determine which metrics/labels you want to add back (i.e. by using the explorer from Grafana) and then re-edit the appropriate `metricRelabelings:` sections to account for the un-dropped metrics/labels.

## Prometheus Analysis

### Go Pprof

To analyse the memory allocations of prometheus, run `kubectl port-forward prometheus-prometheus-0 9090:9090`, and then run `go tool pprof -symbolize=remote -inuse_space localhost:9090/debug/pprof/heap`. Once you get the interpreter, you can run `top` or `dot` for a more detailed hierarchy of the memory usage.

### TSDB

To analyse the TSDB of prometheus, exec into the `prometheus-prometheus-0` pod, `cd` into `/tmp`, and run the following code-block:

```bash
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v1.7.3/prometheus-1.7.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf prometheus-*
cd prometheus-*
./tsdb analyze /prometheus | less
```

*Useful link: https://www.robustperception.io/using-tsdb-analyze-to-investigate-churn-and-cardinality*

Or you can go to `localhost:9090` -> `Status` -> `TSDB Status`, but it's not as complete as running a binary analysis.
