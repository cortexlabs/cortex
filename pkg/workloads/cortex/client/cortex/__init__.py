    To deploy and manage APIs on a new cluster:
        1. Spin up a cluster using the CLI command `cortex cluster up`.
           An environment named "aws" will be created once the cluster is ready.
        2. Initialize your client:
           import cortex
           c = cortex.client("aws")
           c.deploy("./cortex.yaml")

    To deploy and manage APIs on an existing cluster:
        1. Use the command `cortex cluster info` to get the Operator Endpoint.
        2. Configure a client to your cluster:
           import cortex
           c = cortex.cluster_client("aws", operator_endpoint, aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key)
