# Build machine learning APIs

<br>

Cortex makes deploying, scaling, and managing machine learning systems in production simple. We believe that developers in any organization should be able to add natural language processing, computer vision, and other machine learning capabilities to their applications without having to worry about infrastructure.

<br>

## Deploy

* Deploy TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and other models as web APIs.
* Define preprocessing and postprocessing steps in Python.
* Run Cortex locally on any machine or as a production cluster on AWS.

<br>

## Manage

* Update APIs with no downtime.
* Stream logs from deployed models to your CLI.
* Track API performance and predictions.

<br>

## Scale

* Automatically scale APIs to handle production traffic.
* Reduce your cloud infrastructure spend with spot instances.
* Maximize resource utilization by deploying multiple models per API.

<br>

## How it works

## Get started

<!-- CORTEX_VERSION_README_MINOR -->
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cortexlabs/cortex/0.18/get-cli.sh)"
```

* Deploy [text generation](https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/tree/0.18/examples/pytorch/text-generator), [image classification](https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/tree/0.18/examples/tensorflow/image-classifier), or any of our other [example APIs](https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/tree/0.18/examples).
* Bring your own models to build custom APIs.
* Check out our [docs](https://docs.cortex.dev) and join our community on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/cortexlabs/cortex) to learn more.
