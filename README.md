# Cost-effective serverless computing

Cortex is a highly-scalable and cost-effective serverless computing platform that runs in your AWS account. It scales microservices, data processing, machine learning, and other compute-intensive workloads. Cortex is designed to handle production traffic of up to 10M QPS at up to 75% less than the cost of AWS Lambda.

## Maximize instance utilization

**Workload autoscaling** - set autoscaling policies for each workload based on its traffic.

**Resource requests** - configure CPU, GPU, and memory requests for each workload, without limits.

**Container deployments** - customize the runtime and request concurrency for each container.

<br>

## Minimize instance costs

**Cluster autoscaling** - Cortex elastically scales your cluster to meet demand.

**Spot instances** - Cortex manages spot and reserved instances without sacrificing reliability.

**Multi-instance** - Cortex runs each workload on the instance with the optimal price-performance ratio.

<br>

## Monitor your spend

**Workload observability** - monitor workload performance and resource utilization with pre-built dashboards.

**Predictable spend** - predict your spend based on estimates that use the latest AWS pricing information.

**Cost breakdowns** - visualize your cost per workload to optimize your deployments.
