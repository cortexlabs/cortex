# Build your own serverless platform on AWS

Cortex enables platform engineering teams to build modern internal developer platforms, faster. It provides serverless building blocks, simple cluster management, CI/CD and observability integrations, enterprise-grade security, and AWS spend management. Organizations worldwide use Cortex to build platforms for microservices, data processing, machine learning, and other compute-intensive applications.

<br>

## Serverless building blocks

**Realtime workloads** - respond to requests in real-time and autoscale based on in-flight request volumes.

**Async workloads** - process requests asynchronously and autoscale based on request queue length.

**Batch workloads** - run distributed and fault-tolerant batch processing jobs on-demand.

<br>

## Simple cluster management

**Autoscaling** - elastically scale your cluster to meet demand.

**Multi-instance** - create clusters with CPU and GPU instances.

**Environments** - manage multiple clusters from a single interface.

<br>

## CI/CD and observability integrations

**Provisioning** - provision clusters with declarative configuration or a Terraform provider.

**Metrics** - send metrics to any monitoring tool or use pre-built Grafana dashboards.

**Logs** - stream logs to any log management tool or use the pre-built CloudWatch integration.

<br>

## Enterprise-grade security

**EKS** - run on top of EKS to scale workloads reliably and cost-effectively.

**VPC** - deploy clusters into a VPC on your AWS account to keep your data private.

**IAM** - integrate with IAM for authentication and authorization workflows.

<br>

## AWS spend management

**Spot instances** - run workloads on spot instances with automated on-demand backups.

**Reserved instances** - use reserved instances to unlock additional savings.

**Resource limits** - set limits on resource consumption per workload and cluster-wide.
