**Machine learning infrastructure for developers: build  machine learning applications faster.**

Cortex is an open-source platform for building, deploying, and managing machine learning systems in production. It is designed for any developer who wants to build machine learning powered web services.

Cortex is actively maintained by Cortex Labs. We're a venture-backed team of infrastructure engineers and [we're hiring](https://angel.co/cortex-labs-inc/jobs).
