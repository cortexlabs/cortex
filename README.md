# Upgrade your Kubernetes cluster

Cortex helps platform engineering teams build modern internal developer platforms, faster. It builds on top of Kubernetes and AWS services to provide serverless container deployments, streamlined cluster management, CI/CD and observability integrations, enterprise-grade security, and AWS spend management. Organizations worldwide use Cortex to scale microservices, data processing, machine learning, and other compute-intensive workloads in production.

<br>

## Enable serverless container deployments

**Realtime APIs** - respond to requests in real-time and autoscale based on in-flight request volumes.

**Async APIs** - process requests asynchronously and autoscale based on request queue length.

**Batch APIs** - run distributed and fault-tolerant batch processing jobs on-demand.

<br>

## Streamline cluster management

**Autoscaling** - elastically scale your cluster to meet demand.

**Multi-instance** - create clusters with CPU and GPU instances.

**Environments** - manage multiple clusters from a single interface.

<br>

## Integrate with CI/CD and observability tools

**Provisioning** - provision clusters with declarative configuration or a Terraform provider.

**Metrics** - send metrics to any monitoring tool or use pre-built Grafana dashboards.

**Logs** - stream logs to any log management tool or use the pre-built CloudWatch integration.

<br>

## Run workloads securely on your AWS account

**EKS** - run on top of EKS to scale workloads reliably and cost-effectively.

**VPC** - deploy clusters into a VPC on your AWS account to keep your data private.

**IAM** - integrate with IAM for authentication and authorization workflows.

<br>

## Reduce your AWS spend

**Spot instances** - run workloads on spot instances with automated on-demand backups.

**Reserved instances** - use reserved instances to unlock additional savings.

**Resource limits** - set limits on resource consumption per workload and cluster-wide.
