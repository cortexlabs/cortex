# Build your own serverless platform

Build modern internal developer platforms without worrying about infrastructure.

<br>

## Deploy, manage, and scale containers in production

**Realtime workloads** - respond to requests in real-time and autoscale based on in-flight request volumes.

**Async workloads** - process requests asynchronously and autoscale based on request queue length.

**Batch workloads** - run distributed and fault-tolerant batch processing jobs on-demand.

<br>

## Control and minimize your AWS spend

**Cluster autoscaling** - elastically scale clusters with CPU and GPU instances.

**Spot instances** - run workloads on spot instances with automated on-demand backups.

**Environments** - create multiple clusters with different configurations.

<br>

## Integrate with your CI/CD and observability tools

**Provisioning** - provision clusters with declarative configuration or a Terraform provider.

**Metrics** - send metrics to any monitoring tool or use pre-built Grafana dashboards.

**Logs** - stream logs to any log management tool or use the pre-built CloudWatch integration.

<br>

## Build on your AWS account

**Elastic Kubernetes Service** - Cortex runs on top of EKS to scale workloads reliably and cost-effectively.

**Virtual Private Cloud** - deploy clusters into a VPC on your AWS account to keep your data private.

**Identity and Access Management** - integrate with IAM for authentication and authorization workflows.
