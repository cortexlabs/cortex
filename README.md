**Machine learning infrastructure for developers: build machine learning applications faster.**

Cortex is an open-source platform for building, deploying, and managing machine learning applications in production. It is designed for any developer who wants to build machine learning powered services without having to worry about infrastructure challenges like configuring data pipelines, continuous deployment, and dependency management.

Cortex is actively maintained by Cortex Labs. We're a venture-backed team of infrastructure engineers and [we're hiring](https://angel.co/cortex-labs-inc/jobs).

## Key Features

- **End-to-end machine learning workflow:** Cortex spans the machine learning workflow from raw data ingestion to prediction serving.

- **Machine learning pipelines as code:** Cortex applications are defined using a simple declarative syntax that enables flexibility and reusability.

- **Scalability:** Cortex is designed to scale to handle production workloads.

- **Spark & TensorFlow support:** Cortex supports custom [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) code for data processing and custom [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) code for model training.

- **Built for the cloud:** Cortex can be deployed on AWS in minutes.
