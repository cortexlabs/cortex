# Serverless containers on AWS

Avoid the complexity of Kubernetes, service meshes, load balancers, queues, and autoscalers. Deploy, manage, and scale containers on a Kubernetes-based serverless platform that is up to 75% less expensive than Lambda.

<br>

## Build production-grade microservices faster

**Autoscaling** - customize autoscaling for realtime, async, and batch workloads.

**Networking** - get HTTP endpoints that can handle large-scale production traffic.

**Observability** - send logs and metrics from every workload to any monitoring tool.

<br>

## Allocate CPU, GPU, and memory without limits

**No resource limits** - allocate as much CPU, GPU, and memory as each workload requires.

**No cold starts** - keep a minimum number of replicas running to minimize latency.

**No timeouts** - run workloads for as long as you want.

<br>

## Save up to 75% on your AWS bill

**Spot instances** - run workloads on spot and/or reserved instances without affecting reliability.

**Custom instances** - use instances with the optimal price-performance ratio for your workloads.

**Scale to zero** - scale workloads to zero to minimize idle resources.
