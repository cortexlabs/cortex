# Cost-effective serverless computing

Cortex is a highly-scalable serverless computing platform that is up to 90% less expensive than AWS Lambda. It is designed for scaling compute-intensive realtime, async, and batch workloads on your AWS account. Organizations worldwide use Cortex to scale microservices, data processing, machine learning, and other applications in production.

## Maximize compute utilization

**Workload autoscaling** - set autoscaling policies per workload based on its traffic.

**Resource requests** - configure CPU, GPU, and memory requests per workload, without limits.

**Container deployments** - customize the runtime and request concurrency for each container.

<br>

## Minimize compute costs

**Cluster autoscaling** - elastically scale your cluster to meet demand.

**Spot instances** - run workloads on spot instances without sacrificing reliability.

**Multi-instance** - use multiple instance types to optimize price-performance ratio per workload.

<br>

## Visualize and control spend

**Metrics dashboard** - monitor latency and resource utilization with pre-built dashboards.

**Spend visibility** - visualize your spend using the latest AWS pricing information.

**Resource limits** - set limits on resource consumption globally and per workload.
