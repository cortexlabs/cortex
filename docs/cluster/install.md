# Install

## Prerequisites

1. [AWS credentials](aws.md)
2. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install)

## Installation

See [cluster configuration](config.md) for how to customize your installation.

<!-- CORTEX_VERSION_MINOR -->
```bash
# Install the Cortex CLI on your machine
bash -c "$(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cortexlabs/cortex/master/get-cli.sh)"

# Provision infrastructure on AWS and install Cortex
cortex cluster install
```

This will create resources in your AWS account which aren't included in the free teir, e.g. an EKS cluster, two Elastic Load Balancers, and EC2 instances (quantity and type as specified above). To use GPU nodes, you may need to subscribe to the [EKS-optimized AMI with GPU Support](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07GRHFXGM) and [file an AWS support ticket](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/cases#/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=ec2-instances) to incease the limit for your desired instance type.

## Create a deployment

<!-- CORTEX_VERSION_MINOR -->

```bash
# Clone the Cortex repository
git clone -b master https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex.git

# Navigate to the iris classification example
cd cortex/examples/iris-classifier

# Deploy the model to the cluster
cortex deploy

# View the status of the deployment
cortex get --watch

# Get the API's endpoint
cortex get tensorflow

# Classify a sample
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{ "sepal_length": 5.2, "sepal_width": 3.6, "petal_length": 1.4, "petal_width": 0.3 }' \
     <API endpoint>
```

## Cleanup

```bash
# Delete the deployment
cortex delete iris
```

See [uninstall](uninstall.md) if you'd like to uninstall Cortex.
