# APIs

Serve models at scale.

## Config

```yaml
- kind: api
  name: <string>  # API name (required)
  model: <string>  # path to an exported model (e.g. s3://my-bucket/exported_model)
  endpoint: <string>  # the endpoint for the API (default: /<deployment_name>/<api_name>)
  model_format: <string>  # model format, must be "tensorflow" or "onnx" (default: "onnx" if model path ends with .onnx, "tensorflow" if model path ends with .zip or is a directory)
  request_handler: <string>  # path to the request handler implementation file, relative to the cortex root
  tf_signature_key: <string>  # name of the signature def to use for prediction (required if your model has more than one signature def)
  tracker:
    key: <string>  # key to track (required if the response payload is a JSON object)
    model_type: <string>  # model type, must be "classification" or "regression"
  compute:
    min_replicas: <int>  # minimum number of replicas (default: 1)
    max_replicas: <int>  # maximum number of replicas (default: 100)
    init_replicas: <int>  # initial number of replicas (default: <min_replicas>)
    target_cpu_utilization: <int>  # CPU utilization threshold (as a percentage) to trigger scaling (default: 80)
    cpu: <string | int | float>  # CPU request per replica (default: 200m)
    gpu: <int>  # GPU request per replica (default: 0)
    mem: <string>  # memory request per replica (default: Null)
```

See [packaging models](packaging-models.md) for how to export the model.

## Example

```yaml
- kind: api
  name: my-api
  model: s3://my-bucket/my-model.onnx
  request_handler: handler.py
  compute:
    gpu: 1
```

## Custom Request Handlers

Request handlers are used to decouple the interface of an API endpoint from its model. A `pre_inference` request handler can be used to modify request payloads before they are sent to the model. A `post_inference` request handler can be used to modify model predictions in the server before they are sent to the client.

See [request handlers](request-handlers.md) for a detailed guide.

## Prediction Monitoring

`tracker` can be configured to collect API prediction metrics and display real-time stats in `cortex get <api_name>`. The tracker looks for scalar values in the response payload (after the execution of the `post_inference` request handler, if provided). If the response payload is a JSON object, `key` can be set to extract the desired scalar value. For regression models, the tracker should be configured with `model_type: regression` to collect float values and display regression stats such as min, max and average. For classification models, the tracker should be configured with `model_type: classification` to collect integer or string values and display the class distribution.

## Debugging

You can log more information about each request by adding a `?debug=true` parameter to your requests. This will print:

1. The raw sample
2. The value after running the `pre_inference` function (if applicable)
3. The value after running inference
4. The value after running the `post_inference` function (if applicable)

## Autoscaling Replicas

Cortex adjusts the number of replicas that are serving predictions by monitoring the compute resource usage of each API. The number of replicas will be at least `min_replicas` and no more than `max_replicas`.

## Autoscaling Nodes

Cortex spins up and down nodes based on the aggregate resource requests of all APIs. The number of nodes will be at least `min_instances` and no more than `max_instances` (configured during installation and modifiable via the [AWS console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-manual-scaling.html)).
