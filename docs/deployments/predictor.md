# Predictor APIs

You can deploy models from any Python framework by implementing Cortex's Predictor interface. The interface consists of an `init()` function and a `predict()` function. The `init()` function is responsible for preparing the model for serving, downloading vocabulary files, etc. The `predict()` function is called on every request and is responsible for responding with a prediction.

In addition to supporting Python models via the Predictor interface, Cortex can serve the following exported model formats:

- [TensorFlow](tensorflow.md)
- [ONNX](onnx.md)

## Configuration

```yaml
- kind: api
  name: <string>  # API name (required)
  endpoint: <string>  # the endpoint for the API (default: /<deployment_name>/<api_name>)
  predictor:
    path: <string>  # path to the predictor Python file, relative to the Cortex root (required)
    model: <string>  # S3 path to a file or directory (e.g. s3://my-bucket/exported_model) (optional)
    python_path: <string>  # path to the root of your Python folder that will be appended to PYTHONPATH (default: folder containing cortex.yaml)
    metadata: <string: value>  # dictionary that can be used to configure custom values (optional)
  tracker:
    key: <string>  # the JSON key in the response to track (required if the response payload is a JSON object)
    model_type: <string>  # model type, must be "classification" or "regression" (required)
  compute:
    min_replicas: <int>  # minimum number of replicas (default: 1)
    max_replicas: <int>  # maximum number of replicas (default: 100)
    init_replicas: <int>  # initial number of replicas (default: <min_replicas>)
    target_cpu_utilization: <int>  # CPU utilization threshold (as a percentage) to trigger scaling (default: 80)
    cpu: <string | int | float>  # CPU request per replica (default: 200m)
    gpu: <int>  # GPU request per replica (default: 0)
    mem: <string>  # memory request per replica (default: Null)
```

### Example

```yaml
- kind: api
  name: my-api
  predictor:
    path: predictor.py
  compute:
    gpu: 1
```

## Debugging

You can log information about each request by adding a `?debug=true` parameter to your requests. This will print:

1. The payload
2. The value after running the `predict` function

# Predictor

A Predictor is a Python file that describes how to initialize a model and use it to make a prediction.

The lifecycle of a replica running a Predictor starts with loading the implementation file and executing code in the global scope. Once the implementation is loaded, Cortex calls the `init()` function to allow for any additional preparations. The `init()` function is typically used to download and initialize the model. It receives the metadata object, which is an arbitrary dictionary defined in the API configuration (it can be used to pass in the path to the exported/pickled model, vocabularies, aggregates, etc). Once the `init()` function is executed, the replica is available to accept requests. Upon receiving a request, the replica calls the `predict()` function with the JSON payload and the metadata object. The `predict()` function is responsible for returning a prediction based on the request payload.

Global variables can be shared across functions safely because each replica handles one request at a time.

## Implementation

```python
# initialization code and variables can be declared here in global scope

def init(model_path, metadata):
    """Called once before the API is made available. Setup for model serving such
    as downloading/initializing the model or downloading vocabulary can be done here.
    Optional.

    Args:
        model_path: Local path to model file or directory if specified by user in API configuration, otherwise None.
        metadata: Custom dictionary specified by the user in API configuration.
    """
    pass

def predict(payload, metadata):
    """Called once per request. Model prediction is done here, including any
    preprocessing of the request payload and postprocessing of the model output.
    Required.

    Args:
        payload: The JSON request payload (parsed in Python).
        metadata: Custom dictionary specified by the user in API configuration.

    Returns:
        A prediction
    """
```

## Example

```python
import boto3
from my_model import IrisNet

# variables declared in global scope can be used safely in both functions (one replica handles one request at a time)
labels = ["iris-setosa", "iris-versicolor", "iris-virginica"]
model = IrisNet()

def init(model_path, metadata):
    # Initialize the model
    model.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_path))
    model.eval()


def predict(payload, metadata):
    # Convert the request to a tensor and pass it into the model
    input_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(
        [
            [
                payload["sepal_length"],
                payload["sepal_width"],
                payload["petal_length"],
                payload["petal_width"],
            ]
        ]
    )

    # Run the prediction
    output = model(input_tensor)

    # Translate the model output to the corresponding label string
    return labels[torch.argmax(output[0])]
```
