# Python APIs

_WARNING: you are on the master branch, please refer to the docs on the branch that matches your `cortex version`_

You can deploy models from any Python framework by defining a class that implements Cortex's Python Predictor interface. The class constructor is responsible for preparing the model for serving, downloading vocabulary files, etc. The `predict()` class function is called on every request and is responsible for responding with a prediction.

In addition to supporting Python models via the Python Predictor interface, Cortex can serve the following exported model formats:

- [TensorFlow](tensorflow.md)
- [ONNX](onnx.md)

  update_strategy:
    max_surge: <string | int>  # maximum number of replicas that can be scheduled above the desired number of replicas during an update; can be an absolute number, e.g. 5, or a percentage of desired replicas, e.g. 10% (default: 25%)
    max_unavailable: <string | int>  # maximum number of replicas that can be unavailable during an update; can be an absolute number, e.g. 5, or a percentage of desired replicas, e.g. 10% (default: 25%)
```

### Example

```yaml
- name: my-api
  predictor:
    type: python
    path: predictor.py
  compute:
    gpu: 1
```

## Debugging

You can log information about each request by adding a `?debug=true` parameter to your requests. This will print:

1. The payload
2. The value after running the `predict` function

# Python Predictor

A Python Predictor is a Python class that describes how to initialize a model and use it to make a prediction.

The lifecycle of a replica starts with the initialization of the Python Predictor class defined in your implementation file. The constructor is responsible for downloading and initializing the model. It receives the config object, which is an arbitrary dictionary defined in the API configuration (e.g. `cortex.yaml`) that can be used to pass in the path to the exported model, vocabularies, etc. After successfully initializing an instance of the Python Predictor class, the replica is available to serve requests. Upon receiving a request, the replica calls the `predict()` function with the JSON payload. The `predict()` function is responsible for returning a prediction or a batch of predictions. Preprocessing of the JSON payload and postprocessing of predictions can be implemented in your `predict()` function.

## Implementation

```python
# initialization code and variables can be declared here in global scope

class PythonPredictor:
    def __init__(self, config):
        """Called once before the API becomes available. Setup for model serving such as downloading/initializing the model or downloading vocabulary can be done here. Required.

        Args:
            config: Dictionary passed from API configuration (if specified).
        """
        pass

    def predict(self, payload):
        """Called once per request. Runs preprocessing of the request payload, inference, and postprocessing of the inference output. Required.

        Args:
            payload: The parsed JSON request payload.

        Returns:
            Prediction or a batch of predictions.
        """
```

## Example

```python
import boto3
from my_model import IrisNet

labels = ["setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"]

class PythonPredictor:
    def __init__(self, config):
        # download the model
        bucket, key = re.match("s3://(.+?)/(.+)", config["model"]).groups()
        s3 = boto3.client("s3")
        s3.download_file(bucket, key, "model.pth")

        # initialize the model
        model = IrisNet()
        model.load_state_dict(torch.load(config['model']))
        model.eval()

        self.model = model


    def predict(self, payload):
        # Convert the request to a tensor and pass it into the model
        input_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(
            [
                [
                    payload["sepal_length"],
                    payload["sepal_width"],
                    payload["petal_length"],
                    payload["petal_width"],
                ]
            ]
        )

        # Run the prediction
        output = self.model(input_tensor)

        # Translate the model output to the corresponding label string
        return labels[torch.argmax(output[0])]
```
