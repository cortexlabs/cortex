# ONNX APIs

_WARNING: you are on the master branch, please refer to the docs on the branch that matches your `cortex version`_

You can deploy ONNX models as web services by defining a class that implements Cortex's ONNX Predictor interface.

    downscale_tolerance: <float>  # any recommendation falling within this factor below the current number of replicas will not trigger a scale down event (default: 0.1)
    upscale_tolerance: <float>  # any recommendation falling within this factor above the current number of replicas will not trigger a scale up event (default: 0.1)
  update_strategy:
    max_surge: <string | int>  # maximum number of replicas that can be scheduled above the desired number of replicas during an update; can be an absolute number, e.g. 5, or a percentage of desired replicas, e.g. 10% (default: 25%)
    max_unavailable: <string | int>  # maximum number of replicas that can be unavailable during an update; can be an absolute number, e.g. 5, or a percentage of desired replicas, e.g. 10% (default: 25%)
```

See [packaging ONNX models](../packaging-models/onnx.md) for information about exporting ONNX models.

## Example

```yaml
- name: my-api
  predictor:
    type: onnx
    path: predictor.py
    model: s3://my-bucket/my-model.onnx
  compute:
    gpu: 1
```

## Debugging

You can log information about each request by adding a `?debug=true` parameter to your requests. This will print:

1. The payload
2. The value after running the `predict` function

# ONNX Predictor

An ONNX Predictor is a Python class that describes how to serve your ONNX model to make predictions.

<!-- CORTEX_VERSION_MINOR -->
Cortex provides an `onnx_client` and a config object to initialize your implementation of the ONNX Predictor class. The `onnx_client` is an instance of [ONNXClient](https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/tree/master/pkg/workloads/cortex/lib/client/onnx.py) that manages an ONNX Runtime session and helps make predictions using your model. Once your implementation of the ONNX Predictor class has been initialized, the replica is available to serve requests. Upon receiving a request, your implementation's `predict()` function is called with the JSON payload and is responsible for returning a prediction or batch of predictions. Your `predict()` function should call `onnx_client.predict()` to make an inference against your exported ONNX model. Preprocessing of the JSON payload and postprocessing of predictions can be implemented in your `predict()` function as well.

## Implementation

```python
class ONNXPredictor:
    def __init__(self, onnx_client, config):
        """Called once before the API becomes available. Setup for model serving such as downloading/initializing vocabularies can be done here. Required.

        Args:
            onnx_client: ONNX client which can be used to make predictions.
            config: Dictionary passed from API configuration (if specified).
        """
        pass

    def predict(self, payload):
        """Called once per request. Runs preprocessing of the request payload, inference, and postprocessing of the inference output. Required.

        Args:
            payload: The parsed JSON request payload.

        Returns:
            Prediction or a batch of predictions.
        """
```

## Example

```python
import numpy as np

labels = ["setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"]


class ONNXPredictor:
    def __init__(self, onnx_client, config):
        self.client = onnx_client

    def predict(self, payload):
        model_input = [
            payload["sepal_length"],
            payload["sepal_width"],
            payload["petal_length"],
            payload["petal_width"],
        ]

        prediction = self.client.predict(model_input)
        predicted_class_id = prediction[0][0]
        return labels[predicted_class_id]
```
