# API configuration

_WARNING: you are on the master branch, please refer to the docs on the branch that matches your `cortex version`_

Once your model is [exported](../../guides/exporting.md) and you've implemented a [Predictor](predictors.md), you can configure your API via a YAML file (typically named `cortex.yaml`).

Reference the section below which corresponds to your Predictor type: [Python](#python-predictor), [TensorFlow](#tensorflow-predictor), or [ONNX](#onnx-predictor).

## Python Predictor

    window: <duration>  # the time over which to average the API's concurrency (default: 60s)
    downscale_stabilization_period: <duration>  # the API will not scale below the highest recommendation made during this period (default: 5m)
    upscale_stabilization_period: <duration>  # the API will not scale above the lowest recommendation made during this period (default: 1m)
    max_downscale_factor: <float>  # the maximum factor by which to scale down the API on a single scaling event (default: 0.75)
    max_upscale_factor: <float>  # the maximum factor by which to scale up the API on a single scaling event (default: 1.5)
    downscale_tolerance: <float>  # any recommendation falling within this factor below the current number of replicas will not trigger a scale down event (default: 0.05)

  update_strategy:  # (aws only)
    max_surge: <string | int>  # maximum number of replicas that can be scheduled above the desired number of replicas during an update; can be an absolute number, e.g. 5, or a percentage of desired replicas, e.g. 10% (default: 25%) (set to 0 to disable rolling updates)
    max_unavailable: <string | int>  # maximum number of replicas that can be unavailable during an update; can be an absolute number, e.g. 5, or a percentage of desired replicas, e.g. 10% (default: 25%)
