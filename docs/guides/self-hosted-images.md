# Self-hosted Docker images

_WARNING: you are on the master branch, please refer to the docs on the branch that matches your `cortex version`_

Self-hosted Docker images can be useful for reducing the ingress costs, for accelerating image pulls, or for eliminating the dependency on Cortex's public container registry.

In this guide, we'll use [ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) as the destination container registry. When an ECR repository resides in the same region as your Cortex cluster, there are no costs incurred when pulling images.

## Step 1

Make sure you have the [aws](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv1.html), [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo/blob/master/install.md) utilities installed.

## Step 2

Export the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables in your current shell, or run `aws configure`. These credentials must have access to push to ECR.

## Step 3

Choose a region for your cluster and ECR repositories. In this guide, we'll assume the region is `us-west-2`.

Also, take note of your AWS account ID. The account ID can be found in the _My Account_ section of your AWS console.

## Step 4

You can use the script below to push the Cortex images to your ECR registry. Make sure to update the `ecr_region`, `aws_account_id`, and `cortex_version` variables at the top of the file. Copy-paste the contents into a new file (e.g. `ecr.sh`), and then run `chmod +x ecr.sh`, followed by `./ecr.sh`. It is recommended to run this from an EC2 instance in the same region as your ECR repository, since it will be much faster.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# user set variables
ecr_region="us-west-2"
aws_account_id="620970939130"  # example account ID
cortex_version="0.22.1"

source_registry="quay.io/cortexlabs"
destination_ecr_prefix="cortexlabs"

destination_registry="${aws_account_id}.dkr.ecr.${ecr_region}.amazonaws.com/${destination_ecr_prefix}"
aws ecr get-login-password --region $ecr_region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $destination_registry

```

The first list of images that were printed (the cluster images) can be directly copy-pasted in your [cluster configuration file](../aws/install.md) before spinning up your cluster.

The second list of images that were printed (the API images) can be used in your [API configuration files](../deployments/realtime-api/api-configuration.md). The image paths are specified in `predictor.image` (and `predictor.tensorflow_serving_image` for APIs with `kind: tensorflow`). Be advised that by default, the public images offered by Cortex are used for your predictors, so you will need to specify your ECR image paths for all of your APIs.

## Step 5

Spin up your Cortex cluster using your updated cluster configuration file (e.g. `cortex cluster up --config cluster.yaml`).

## Cleanup

You can delete your ECR images from the [AWS ECR dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories) (set your region in the upper right corner). Make sure all of your Cortex clusters have been deleted before deleting any ECR images.
