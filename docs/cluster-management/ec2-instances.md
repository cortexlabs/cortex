# EC2 instances

_WARNING: you are on the master branch, please refer to the docs on the branch that matches your `cortex version`_

There are a variety of instance types to choose from when creating a Cortex cluster. If you are unsure about which instance to pick, review these options as a starting point.

This is not a comprehensive guide so please refer to the [AWS's documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) for more information.

Note: There is an instance limit associated with your AWS account for each instance family in each region, for on-demand and for spot instances. You can check your current limit and request an increase [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?#!/services/ec2/quotas) (set the region in the upper right corner to your desired region, type "on-demand" or "spot" in the search bar, and click on the quota that matches your instance type). Note that the quota values indicate the number of vCPUs available, not the number of instances; different instances have a different numbers of vCPUs, which can be seen [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).
