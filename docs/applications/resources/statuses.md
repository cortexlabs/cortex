# Resource Statuses

## Statuses

| Status               | Meaning |
|----------------------|---|
| ready                | Resource is ready |
| pending              | Resource is waiting for another resource to be ready, or its workload is initializing |
| running, ingesting,<br>aggregating, transforming,<br>generating, training | Resource is being created |
| error                | Resource was not created due to an error; run `cortex logs <name>` to view the logs |
| skipped              | Resource was not created due to an error in another resource in the same workload |
| terminated           | Resource was terminated |
| upstream error       | Resource was not created due to an error in one of its dependencies |
| upstream termination | Resource was not created because one of its dependencies was terminated |
| compute unavailable  | Resource's workload could not start due to insufficient memory, CPU or GPU in the cluster |

## API statuses

| Status               | Meaning |
|----------------------|---|
| ready                | API is deployed and ready to serve prediction requests |

| updating             | API is performing a rolling update |
| update pending       | API will be updated when the new model is ready; a previous version of this API is ready |
| stopping             | API is stopping |
| stopped              | API is stopped |
| error                | API was not created due to an error; run `cortex logs <name>` to view the logs |
| skipped              | API was not created due to an error in another resource |
| update skipped       | API was not updated due to an error in another resource; a previous version of this API is ready |
| upstream error       | API was not created due to an error in one of its dependencies; a previous version of this API may be ready |
| upstream termination | API was not created because one of its dependencies was terminated; a previous version of this API may be ready |
| compute unavailable  | API could not start due to insufficient memory, CPU or GPU in the cluster; some replicas may be ready |
