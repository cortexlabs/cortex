    ...
```

## Example

```yaml
- kind: template
  name: normalize
  yaml: |
    - kind: aggregate
      name: {feature}_mean
      aggregator: cortex.mean
      inputs:
        features:
          col: {feature}

    - kind: aggregate
      name: {feature}_stddev
      aggregator: cortex.stddev
      inputs:
        features:
          col: {feature}

    - kind: transformed_feature
