# Predictor implementation

Which Predictor you use depends on how your model is exported:

* [TensorFlow Predictor](#tensorflow-predictor) if your model is exported as a TensorFlow `SavedModel`
* [ONNX Predictor](#onnx-predictor) if your model is exported in the ONNX format
* [Python Predictor](#python-predictor) for all other cases

## Project files

Cortex makes all files in the project directory (i.e. the directory which contains `cortex.yaml`) available for use in your Predictor implementation. Python bytecode files (`*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, `*.pyd`), files or folders that start with `.`, and the api configuration file (e.g. `cortex.yaml`) are excluded.

The following files can also be added at the root of the project's directory:

* `.cortexignore` file, which follows the same syntax and behavior as a [.gitignore file](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).
* `.env` file, which exports environment variables that can be used in the predictor. Each line of this file must follow the `VARIABLE=value` format.

For example, if your directory looks like this:

```text
./my-classifier/
├── cortex.yaml
├── values.json
├── predictor.py
├── ...
└── requirements.txt
```

You can access `values.json` in your Predictor like this:

```python
import json

class PythonPredictor:
    def __init__(self, config):
        with open('values.json', 'r') as values_file:
            values = json.load(values_file)
        self.values = values
```

## Python Predictor

### Interface

```python
# initialization code and variables can be declared here in global scope

class PythonPredictor:
    def __init__(self, config, job_spec):
        """(Required) Called once during each worker initialization. Performs
        setup such as downloading/initializing the model or downloading a
        vocabulary.

        Args:
            config (required): Dictionary passed from API configuration (if
                specified) merged with configuration passed in with Job
                Submission API. If there are conflicting keys, values in
                configuration specified in Job submission takes precedence.
            job_spec (optional): Dictionary containing the following fields:
                "job_id": A unique ID for this job
                "api_name": The name of this batch API

## TensorFlow Predictor

        setup such as downloading/initializing the model or downloading a

<!-- CORTEX_VERSION_MINOR -->
Cortex provides a `tensorflow_client` to your Predictor's constructor. `tensorflow_client` is an instance of [TensorFlowClient](https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/tree/0.31/pkg/cortex/serve/cortex_internal/lib/client/tensorflow.py) that manages a connection to a TensorFlow Serving container to make predictions using your model. It should be saved as an instance variable in your Predictor, and your `predict()` function should call `tensorflow_client.predict()` to make an inference with your exported TensorFlow model. Preprocessing of the JSON payload and postprocessing of predictions can be implemented in your `predict()` function as well.

When multiple models are defined using the Predictor's `models` field, the `tensorflow_client.predict()` method expects a second argument `model_name` which must hold the name of the model that you want to use for inference (for example: `self.client.predict(payload, "text-generator")`).

If you need to share files between your predictor implementation and the TensorFlow Serving container, you can create a new directory within `/mnt` (e.g. `/mnt/user`) and write files to it. The entire `/mnt` directory is shared between containers, but do not write to any of the directories in `/mnt` that already exist (they are used internally by Cortex).

## ONNX Predictor

**Uses ONNX Runtime version 1.6.0 by default**

### Interface

```python
class ONNXPredictor:
    def __init__(self, onnx_client, config, job_spec):
        """(Required) Called once during each worker initialization. Performs
        setup such as downloading/initializing the model or downloading a
        vocabulary.

        Args:
            onnx_client (required): ONNX client which is used to make
                predictions. This should be saved for use in predict().
            config (required): Dictionary passed from API configuration (if
                specified) merged with configuration passed in with Job
                Submission API. If there are conflicting keys, values in
                configuration specified in Job submission takes precedence.
            job_spec (optional): Dictionary containing the following fields:

                "total_batch_count": The total number of batches in this job
                "start_time": The time that this job started
        """
        self.client = onnx_client
        # Additional initialization may be done here

        """
        pass
```

<!-- CORTEX_VERSION_MINOR -->
Cortex provides an `onnx_client` to your Predictor's constructor. `onnx_client` is an instance of [ONNXClient](https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/tree/0.31/pkg/cortex/serve/cortex_internal/lib/client/onnx.py) that manages an ONNX Runtime session to make predictions using your model. It should be saved as an instance variable in your Predictor, and your `predict()` function should call `onnx_client.predict()` to make an inference with your exported ONNX model. Preprocessing of the JSON payload and postprocessing of predictions can be implemented in your `predict()` function as well.

When multiple models are defined using the Predictor's `models` field, the `onnx_client.predict()` method expects a second argument `model_name` which must hold the name of the model that you want to use for inference (for example: `self.client.predict(model_input, "text-generator")`).

## Structured logging

You can use Cortex's logger in your predictor implemention to log in JSON. This will enrich your logs with Cortex's metadata, and you can add custom metadata to the logs by adding key value pairs to the `extra` key when using the logger. For example:

```python
...
from cortex_internal.lib.log import logger as cortex_logger

class PythonPredictor:
    def predict(self, payload, batch_id):
        ...
        cortex_logger.info("completed processing batch", extra={"batch_id": batch_id, "confidence": confidence})
```

The dictionary passed in via the `extra` will be flattened by one level. e.g.

```text
{"asctime": "2021-01-19 15:14:05,291", "levelname": "INFO", "message": "completed processing batch", "process": 235, "batch_id": "iuasyd8f7", "confidence": 0.97}
```

To avoid overriding essential Cortex metadata, please refrain from specifying the following extra keys: `asctime`, `levelname`, `message`, `labels`, and `process`. Log lines greater than 5 MB in size will be ignored.

## Cortex Python client

A default [Cortex Python client](../../clients/python.md#cortex.client.client) environment has been configured for your API. This can be used for deploying/deleting/updating or submitting jobs to your running cluster based on the execution flow of your batch predictor. For example:

```python
import cortex

class PythonPredictor:
    def on_job_complete(self):
        ...
        # get client pointing to the default environment
        client = cortex.client()
        # deploy API in the existing cluster using the artifacts in the previous step
        client.create_api(...)
```
