# Predictor implementation

Which Predictor you use depends on how your model is exported:

* [TensorFlow Predictor](#tensorflow-predictor) if your model is exported as a TensorFlow `SavedModel`
* [ONNX Predictor](#onnx-predictor) if your model is exported in the ONNX format
* [Python Predictor](#python-predictor) for all other cases

The response type of the predictor can vary depending on your requirements, see [API responses](#api-responses) below.

## Project files

Cortex makes all files in the project directory (i.e. the directory which contains `cortex.yaml`) available for use in your Predictor implementation. Python bytecode files (`*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, `*.pyd`), files or folders that start with `.`, and the api configuration file (e.g. `cortex.yaml`) are excluded.

The following files can also be added at the root of the project's directory:

* `.cortexignore` file, which follows the same syntax and behavior as a [.gitignore file](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).
* `.env` file, which exports environment variables that can be used in the predictor. Each line of this file must follow the `VARIABLE=value` format.

For example, if your directory looks like this:

```text
./my-classifier/
├── cortex.yaml
├── values.json
├── predictor.py
├── ...
└── requirements.txt
```

You can access `values.json` in your Predictor like this:

```python
import json

class PythonPredictor:
    def __init__(self, config):
        with open('values.json', 'r') as values_file:
            values = json.load(values_file)
        self.values = values
```

<!-- CORTEX_VERSION_MINOR -->
When explicit model paths are specified in the Python predictor's API configuration, Cortex provides a `python_client` to your Predictor's constructor. `python_client` is an instance of [PythonClient](https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/tree/master/pkg/cortex/serve/cortex_internal/lib/client/python.py) that is used to load model(s) (it calls the `load_model()` method of your predictor, which must be defined when using explicit model paths). It should be saved as an instance variable in your Predictor, and your `predict()` function should call `python_client.get_model()` to load your model for inference. Preprocessing of the JSON payload and postprocessing of predictions can be implemented in your `predict()` function as well.

When multiple models are defined using the Predictor's `models` field, the `python_client.get_model()` method expects an argument `model_name` which must hold the name of the model that you want to load (for example: `self.client.get_model("text-generator")`). There is also an optional second argument to specify the model version.

For proper separation of concerns, it is recommended to use the constructor's `config` parameter for information such as from where to download the model and initialization files, or any configurable model parameters. You define `config` in your API configuration, and it is passed through to your Predictor's constructor.

Your API can accept requests with different types of payloads such as `JSON`-parseable, `bytes` or `starlette.datastructures.FormData` data. Navigate to the [API requests](#api-requests) section to learn about how headers can be used to change the type of `payload` that is passed into your `predict` method.

Your `predictor` method can return different types of objects such as `JSON`-parseable, `string`, and `bytes` objects. Navigate to the [API responses](#api-responses) section to learn about how to configure your `predictor` method to respond with different response codes and content-types.

It should be saved as an instance variable in your Predictor, and your `predict()` function should call `tensorflow_client.predict()` to make an inference with your exported TensorFlow model. Preprocessing of the JSON payload and postprocessing of predictions can be implemented in your `predict()` function as well.

If you need to share files between your predictor implementation and the TensorFlow Serving container, you can create a new directory within `/mnt` (e.g. `/mnt/user`) and write files to it. The entire `/mnt` directory is shared between containers, but do not write to any of the directories in `/mnt` that already exist (they are used internally by Cortex).

<!-- CORTEX_VERSION_MINOR -->
Cortex provides an `onnx_client` to your Predictor's constructor. `onnx_client` is an instance of [ONNXClient](https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/tree/master/pkg/cortex/serve/cortex_internal/lib/client/onnx.py) that manages an ONNX Runtime session to make predictions using your model. It should be saved as an instance variable in your Predictor, and your `predict()` function should call `onnx_client.predict()` to make an inference with your exported ONNX model. Preprocessing of the JSON payload and postprocessing of predictions can be implemented in your `predict()` function as well.

When multiple models are defined using the Predictor's `models` field, the `onnx_client.predict()` method expects a second argument `model_name` which must hold the name of the model that you want to use for inference (for example: `self.client.predict(model_input, "text-generator")`).

You define `config` in your API configuration, and it is passed through to your Predictor's constructor.

Your API can accept requests with different types of payloads such as `JSON`-parseable, `bytes` or `starlette.datastructures.FormData` data. Navigate to the [API requests](#api-requests) section to learn about how headers can be used to change the type of `payload` that is passed into your `predict` method.

Your `predictor` method can return different types of objects such as `JSON`-parseable, `string`, and `bytes` objects. Navigate to the [API responses](#api-responses) section to learn about how to configure your `predictor` method to respond with different response codes and content-types.

## API requests

The type of the `payload` parameter in `predict(self, payload)` can vary based on the content type of the request. The `payload` parameter is parsed according to the `Content-Type` header in the request. Here are the parsing rules (see below for examples):

1. For `Content-Type: application/json`, `payload` will be the parsed JSON body.
1. For `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` / `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `payload` will be `starlette.datastructures.FormData` (key-value pairs where the values are strings for text data, or `starlette.datastructures.UploadFile` for file uploads; see [Starlette's documentation](https://www.starlette.io/requests/#request-files)).
1. For `Content-Type: text/plain`, `payload` will be a string. `utf-8` encoding is assumed, unless specified otherwise (e.g. via `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii`)
1. For all other `Content-Type` values, `payload` will be the raw `bytes` of the request body.

Here are some examples:

### JSON data

#### Making the request

```bash
$ curl http://***.amazonaws.com/my-api \
    -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"key": "value"}'
```

#### Reading the payload

When sending a JSON payload, the `payload` parameter will be a Python object:

```python
class PythonPredictor:
    def __init__(self, config):
        pass

    def predict(self, payload):
        print(payload["key"])  # prints "value"
```

### Binary data

#### Making the request

```bash
$ curl http://***.amazonaws.com/my-api \
    -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
    --data-binary @object.pkl
```

#### Reading the payload

Since the `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` header is used, the `payload` parameter will be a `bytes` object:

```python
import pickle

class PythonPredictor:
    def __init__(self, config):
        pass

    def predict(self, payload):
        obj = pickle.loads(payload)
        print(obj["key"])  # prints "value"
```

Here's an example if the binary data is an image:

```python
from PIL import Image
import io

class PythonPredictor:
    def __init__(self, config):
        pass

    def predict(self, payload, headers):
        img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(payload))  # read the payload bytes as an image
        print(img.size)
```

### Form data (files)

#### Making the request

```bash
$ curl http://***.amazonaws.com/my-api \
    -X POST \
    -F "text=@text.txt" \
    -F "object=@object.pkl" \
    -F "image=@image.png"
```

#### Reading the payload

When sending files via form data, the `payload` parameter will be `starlette.datastructures.FormData` (key-value pairs where the values are `starlette.datastructures.UploadFile`, see [Starlette's documentation](https://www.starlette.io/requests/#request-files)). Either `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` or `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` can be used (typically `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` is used for files, and is the default in the examples above).

```python
from PIL import Image
import pickle

class PythonPredictor:
    def __init__(self, config):
        pass

    def predict(self, payload):
        text = payload["text"].file.read()
        print(text.decode("utf-8"))  # prints the contents of text.txt

        obj = pickle.load(payload["object"].file)
        print(obj["key"])  # prints "value" assuming `object.pkl` is a pickled dictionary {"key": "value"}

        img = Image.open(payload["image"].file)
        print(img.size)  # prints the dimensions of image.png
```

### Form data (text)

#### Making the request

```bash
$ curl http://***.amazonaws.com/my-api \
    -X POST \
    -d "key=value"
```

#### Reading the payload

When sending text via form data, the `payload` parameter will be `starlette.datastructures.FormData` (key-value pairs where the values are strings, see [Starlette's documentation](https://www.starlette.io/requests/#request-files)). Either `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` or `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` can be used (typically `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` is used for text, and is the default in the examples above).

```python
class PythonPredictor:
    def __init__(self, config):
        pass

    def predict(self, payload):
        print(payload["key"])  # will print "value"
```

### Text data

#### Making the request

```bash
$ curl http://***.amazonaws.com/my-api \
    -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
    -d "hello world"
```

#### Reading the payload

Since the `Content-Type: text/plain` header is used, the `payload` parameter will be a `string` object:

```python
class PythonPredictor:
    def __init__(self, config):
        pass

    def predict(self, payload):
        print(payload)  # prints "hello world"
```

## API responses

The response of your `predict()` function may be:

1. A JSON-serializable object (*lists*, *dictionaries*, *numbers*, etc.)

1. A `string` object (e.g. `"class 1"`)

1. A `bytes` object (e.g. `bytes(4)` or `pickle.dumps(obj)`)

1. An instance of [starlette.responses.Response](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#response)

## Chaining APIs

It is possible to make requests from one API to another within a Cortex cluster. All running APIs are accessible from within the predictor at `http://api-<api_name>:8888/predict`, where `<api_name>` is the name of the API you are making a request to.

For example, if there is an api named `text-generator` running in the cluster, you could make a request to it from a different API by using:

```python
import requests

class PythonPredictor:
    def predict(self, payload):
        response = requests.post("http://api-text-generator:8888/predict", json={"text": "machine learning is"})
        # ...
```

Note that the autoscaling configuration (i.e. `target_replica_concurrency`) for the API that is making the request should be modified with the understanding that requests will still be considered "in-flight" with the first API as the request is being fulfilled in the second API (during which it will also be considered "in-flight" with the second API).

## Structured logging

You can use Cortex's logger in your predictor implemention to log in JSON. This will enrich your logs with Cortex's metadata, and you can add custom metadata to the logs by adding key value pairs to the `extra` key when using the logger. For example:

```python
...
from cortex_internal.lib.log import logger as cortex_logger

class PythonPredictor:
    def predict(self, payload):
        cortex_logger.info("received payload", extra={"payload": payload})
```

The dictionary passed in via the `extra` will be flattened by one level. e.g.

```text
{"asctime": "2021-01-19 15:14:05,291", "levelname": "INFO", "message": "received payload", "process": 235, "payload": "this movie is awesome"}
```

To avoid overriding essential Cortex metadata, please refrain from specifying the following extra keys: `asctime`, `levelname`, `message`, `labels`, and `process`. Log lines greater than 5 MB in size will be ignored.
