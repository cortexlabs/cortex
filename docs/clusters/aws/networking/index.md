All APIs share a single API load balancer. By default, the API load balancer is public. You can configure your API load balancer to be private by setting `api_load_balancer_scheme: internal` in your [cluster configuration](../install.md) file (before creating your cluster). This will make your API only accessible through VPC Peering.

The SSL certificate on the API load balancer is autogenerated during installation using `localhost` as the Common Name (CN). Therefore, clients will need to make HTTP requests or skip certificate verification when making HTTPS requests (e.g. `curl -k`). Alternatively, you can enable HTTPS by using a custom domain or by creating an API Gateway to forward requests to your API load balancer.
