# Install

## Prerequisites

1. [AWS credentials](aws.md)

## Download the install script

<!-- CORTEX_VERSION_MINOR -->

```bash
# Download
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cortexlabs/cortex/master/cortex-installer.sh

# Change permissions
chmod +x cortex-installer.sh

# Set AWS credentials
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=***
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=***
```

## Kubernetes

Cortex runs on Kubernetes and requires access to `kubectl`. If you don't already have a Kubernetes cluster, [eksctl](https://eksctl.io) is a simple tool to create and manage one.

**We recommend a minimum cluster size of 2 [t3.medium](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types) AWS instances. Cortex may not run successfully on clusters with less compute resources.**

```bash
# Install kubectl, eksctl, and aws-iam-authenticator
./cortex-installer.sh install kubernetes-tools

# Spin up an EKS cluster (this takes ~20 minutes; see eksctl.io for more options)
eksctl create cluster --name=cortex --nodes=2 --node-type=t3.medium
```

This cluster configuration will cost about $0.29 per hour in AWS fees.

## Install the operator

The Cortex operator is a service that runs on Kubernetes, translates declarative configuration into workloads, and orchestrates those workloads on the cluster. Its installation is configurable. For a full list of configuration options please refer to the [operator config](config.md) documentation.

```bash
# Install the Cortex operator
./cortex-installer.sh install operator
```

## Install the CLI

The CLI runs on developer machines (e.g. your laptop) and communicates with the operator.

```bash
# Install the Cortex CLI
./cortex-installer.sh install cli

# Get the operator endpoint
./cortex-installer.sh get endpoints

# Configure the CLI
cortex configure
```

## Deploy an application

<!-- CORTEX_VERSION_MINOR -->

```bash
# Clone the Cortex repository
git clone -b master https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex.git

# Navigate to the iris classification example
cd cortex/examples/iris

# Deploy the application to the cluster
cortex deploy

# View the status of the deployment
cortex status --watch

# Classify a sample
cortex predict iris-type irises.json
```

## Cleanup

```
# Delete the deployment
$ cortex delete iris
```

See [uninstall](uninstall.md) if you'd like to uninstall Cortex.
