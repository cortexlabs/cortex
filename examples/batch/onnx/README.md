# Batch Image Classifier in ONNX

You can deploy this example by cloning this repo with `git clone -b v<CORTEX_VERSION> https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex`. The `<CORTEX_VERSION>` should be substituted with the version of your Cortex CLI. For example, if the output of `cortex version` is 0.18.1, the clone command would be `git clone -b v0.18.1 https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex`. Then navigate to this example directory.

Please refer to the [tutorial](https://docs.cortex.dev/batchapi/image-classifier#deploy-your-batch-api) to see how to deploy a Batch API with Cortex.
