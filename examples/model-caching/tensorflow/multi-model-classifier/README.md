# Multi-Model Classifier API

_WARNING: you are on the master branch; please refer to examples on the branch corresponding to your `cortex version` (e.g. for version 0.23.*, run `git checkout -b 0.23` or switch to the `0.23` branch on GitHub)_

This example deploys Iris, ResNet50 and Inception models in one API. Query parameters are used for selecting the model.

Since model caching is enabled, there can only be 2 models loaded into memory - loading a 3rd one will lead to the removal of the least recently used one. To witness the adding/removal process of models, check the logs of the API by running `cortex logs multi-model-classifier` once the API is up.

The example can be run on both CPU and on GPU hardware.

## Sample Prediction

Deploy the model by running:

```bash
cortex deploy
```

And wait for it to become live by tracking its status with `cortex get --watch`.

Once the API has been successfully deployed, export the APIs endpoint. You can get the API's endpoint by running `cortex get multi-model-classifier`.

```bash
export ENDPOINT=your-api-endpoint
```

When making a prediction with [sample-image.json](sample-image.json), the following image will be used:

### ResNet50 Classifier

Make a request to the ResNet50 model:

```bash
curl "${ENDPOINT}?model=resnet50" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @sample-image.json
```

The expected response is:

```json
{"label": "sports_car"}
```

### Inception Classifier

Make a request to the Inception model:

```bash
curl "${ENDPOINT}?model=inception" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @sample-image.json
```

The expected response is:

```json
{"label": "sports_car"}
```

### Iris Classifier

At this point, there are 2 models loaded into memory (as specified by `cache_size`). Loading the `iris` classifier will lead to the removal of the least recently used model - in this case, it will be the ResNet50 model that will get evicted. Since the `disk_cache_size` is set to 3, no model will be removed from disk.

Make a request to the Iris model:

```bash
curl "${ENDPOINT}?model=iris" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @sample-iris.json
```

The expected response is:

```json
{"label": "setosa"}
```

Now, inspect `cortex get multi-model-classifier` to see when and which models were removed in this process of making requests to different versions of the same model.
